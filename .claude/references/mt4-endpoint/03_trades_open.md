## Overview

Open trades (positions) in MT4 are `TradeRecord` structs where `close_time == 0`.
These include all market orders that have not yet been closed, as well as pending orders.

In MT4 terminology, an **order** and an **open position** are the same thing — both are `TradeRecord`
entries with `close_time = 0`.

## Methods

| Method | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `TradesRequest` | Get ALL open orders (all accounts) | Bootstrap full sync |
| `TradeRecordsRequest` | Get orders by ticket list | Targeted fetch |
| `AdmTradesRequest` | Admin: get orders by group/account/ticket | Full re-sync by group |
| `TradesGetByLogin` | Get orders for one account (pumping) | Real-time per account |
| `TradesGetBySymbol` | Get orders for one symbol (pumping) | Real-time per symbol |
| `TradesGet` | Get all open orders (pumping) | Real-time full snapshot |
| `TradeRecordGet` | Get single order by ticket (pumping) | Single order lookup |

## Example Code

```python
import ctypes

# ─── TradesRequest — all open orders ────────────────────────────────────────
total = ctypes.c_int(0)
trades_ptr = manager.TradesRequest(ctypes.byref(total))

if not trades_ptr:
    print("TradesRequest failed")
else:
    print(f"Open orders: {total.value}")

    TradeRecordArray = TradeRecord * total.value
    trades = ctypes.cast(trades_ptr, ctypes.POINTER(TradeRecordArray)).contents

    records = [struct_to_dict(t) for t in trades]
    manager.MemFree(trades_ptr)

    # Filter: only open positions (close_time == 0, cmd in BUY/SELL range)
    open_positions = [r for r in records if r["close_time"] == 0 and r["cmd"] < 2]
    pending_orders = [r for r in records if r["close_time"] == 0 and r["cmd"] >= 2]

    print(f"Open positions: {len(open_positions)}")
    print(f"Pending orders: {len(pending_orders)}")


# ─── TradeRecordsRequest — by ticket list ───────────────────────────────────
tickets = (ctypes.c_int * 3)(100001, 100002, 100003)
total2 = ctypes.c_int(0)
trades_ptr2 = manager.TradeRecordsRequest(tickets, 3, ctypes.byref(total2))
# ... same pattern


# ─── AdmTradesRequest — admin, by group ─────────────────────────────────────
total3 = ctypes.c_int(0)
trades_ptr3 = manager.AdmTradesRequest(b"real\\standard", ctypes.byref(total3))
# request string: comma-separated groups, logins, or tickets
# ... same pattern
```

## TradeRecord Structure

The core MT4 trading record. Used for BOTH open positions AND trade history.
Differentiate by `close_time`: `0` = open/pending, `> 0` = closed.

```python
class TradeRecord(ctypes.Structure):
    _fields_ = [
        ("order",          ctypes.c_int),          # ticket number

        ("gw_volume",      ctypes.c_int),          # gateway volume
        ("expiration",     ctypes.c_int),          # pending order expiry (time_t)
        ("reason",         ctypes.c_short),        # close reason
        ("conv_reserv",    ctypes.c_short * 2),    # reserved
        ("conv_rates",     ctypes.c_double * 2),   # conversion rates

        ("close_price",    ctypes.c_double),       # close/current price
        ("profit",         ctypes.c_double),       # floating or realized P&L
        ("taxes",          ctypes.c_double),       # tax amount
        ("magic",          ctypes.c_int),          # EA magic number
        ("comment",        ctypes.c_char * 32),    # order comment
        ("gw_order",       ctypes.c_int),          # gateway order ID
        ("activation",     ctypes.c_int),          # activation flag
        ("gw_open_price",  ctypes.c_double),       # gateway open price
        ("gw_close_price", ctypes.c_double),       # gateway close price

        ("api_data",       ctypes.c_uint8 * 16),   # plugin data
    ]

## Volume Conversion

MT4 stores volume as `int` (lots × 100). To get standard lots:

```python
lots = trade.volume / 100.0   # e.g. volume=100 → 1.00 lot
```

## Notes

- **Memory management**: Always call `manager.MemFree(ptr)` after processing.
- **Volume**: stored as `int` (lots × 100). Convert: `lots = volume / 100.0`.
- **Open vs closed**: filter by `close_time == 0` for open positions.
- **Balance ops**: `cmd == 6` (OP_BALANCE) entries are balance/credit adjustments, not actual trades.
- **Pending orders**: `cmd` in `[2, 3, 4, 5]` are pending orders (not yet filled).
